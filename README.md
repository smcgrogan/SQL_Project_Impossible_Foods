# Impossible Foods Product Improvement
## Project Objective: To help Impossible Foods improve their current product, and determine which markets they should target for any new products or product updates that they release.

What problem are you solving?
Impossible Foods is facing a stagnant revenue stream and needs to expand its customer base.

How are you solving this problem?
To help Impossible Foods figure out how to do that, I will be analyzing survey data of a range of demographics reactions to Impossible's fake meat products and making recommendations based on my results.

Job Description:
  Impossible Foods is a food product company that produces plant-based alternatives to meat products, such as burgers, sausage, and ground beef. Impossible Foods describes themselves as a company focused on "addressing the most catastrophic threats facing humanity: climate change and biodiversity collapse"; and these reasons are the company's motivation for helping the world transition to plant-based foods to reduce CO2 emissions and reverse the "meltdown in wildlife biomass". From the job posting I have chose to address in this project is looking for a Data Science Analyst. Impossible Foods is looking for a candidate to fill the following description (taken from Impossible's job post): "We are looking for a Data Science Analyst to help us lead the way in wrangling, mining, and analyzing our trove of research and development data. You will work collaboratively with a variety of teams across the organization to transform their data ingestion processes for submission into our data pipeline while also building small data-driven applications to improve efficiency. You will be responsible for deep, thoughtful statistical
analyses, cross-organizational consulting, report preparation and presentations."

How the project is related to the job posting:
This project is related to the job posting because I am wrangling, mining, and analyzing data for Impossible Foods to use to improve their product, and increase the amount of the population that are likely to buy their products; therefore, shifting more of the world towards plant-based diets.
